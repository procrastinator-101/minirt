.TH SCENE 5 "28 MARCH 2020" "Version 1.0" "scene manpage"
.SH NAME
scene - the scene configuration file for minirt
.SH DESCRIPTION
the input file for 
.B minirt.
It represents the configuration of the scene simulated by minirt. 
.br
It should contain
.B one
and only
.B one 
of these entities : 
.B RESOLUTION,
.B AMBIENT LIGHT.
Furthermore, at least one
.B CAMERA
should be configured. Otherwise an error is to be expected.
.PP
Each line must respect the folowing rules :
.br
- One and only one entity may be declared per line.
.br
- a line represent the configuration of no more than one entity.
.br
- entities may be seperated by 0 or more empty lines.
the syntax of each entity configuration is detailed in the syntax section.
