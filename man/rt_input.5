.TH SCENE 5 "28 MARCH 2020" "Version 1.0" "scene manpage"
.SH NAME
scene - the scene configuration file for minirt
.SH DESCRIPTION
the input file for 
.B minirt.
It represents the configuration of the scene simulated by minirt. 
.br
It should contain
.B one
and only
.B one 
of these entities : 
.B RESOLUTION,
.B AMBIENT LIGHT.
Furthermore, at least one
.B CAMERA
should be configured. Otherwise an error is to be expected.
.PP
Each line must respect the folowing rules :
.br
- One and only one entity may be declared per line.
.br
- a line represent the configuration of no more than one entity.
.br
- entities may be seperated by 0 or more empty lines.
the syntax of each entity configuration is detailed in the syntax section.

.SH SYNTAX

.SH \tRESOLUTION
.TP
.B ID
R
.TP
.B Width
an integer representing the width of the window. It should be bigger than 0. otherwise, an error is reported.
.TP
.B Height
an integer represnting the height of the window. Like the width, the program reports an error when the height is less than 1.

.SH \tAMBIENT LIGHT
.TP
.B ID
A
.TP
.B Ratio
a real number representing the ratio of the ambient light. It must in the range between 0 and 1.
.TP
.B RGB
an rgb format color : R,G,B. Each of these components should be a positive integer, and should not exceed 255.

.SH \tCAMERA
.TP
.B ID
c
.TP
.B Position
a 3 dimensional coordinates : x,y,z. 
.TP
.B Orientation
a 3 dimensional vector : x,y,z. Each of these components must be in range [-1,1].
.TP
.B FOV
the horizontal field of view of the camera in degrees. It has to be in the range [0,180].

.SH \tLIGHT
.TP
.B ID
l
.TP
.B Position
a 3 dimensional coordinates : x,y,z.
.TP
.B Brightness
the brightness ratio of the light. It should be in the range [0,1].
.TP
.B RGB
an rgb format color : R,G,B. Each of these components should be a positive integer, and should not exceed
255.

.SH \tSPHERE
.TP
.B ID
sp
.TP
.B Position
the 3 dimensional coordinates of the sphere center.
.TP
.B Diameter
the diameter of the sphere. Naturally it should be a positive real number.
.TP
.B RGB1
an rgb format color : R,G,B. Each of these components should be a positive integer, and should not exceed
255.
.TP
.B RGB2
an rgb format color : R,G,B. Each of these components should be a positive integer, and should not exceed 255. This information is only given in the case of a chechered color. Otherwise, it is left empty.
.TP
.B Length
a positive real number that represents the length of the grid if a checkered color is used. When filled with 0, a
.B default
length will be chosen by the program. Like the
.B RGB2
field, the length is only given in the case of a checkered color. Otherwise, it is left empty.

.SH \tPLANE
.TP
.B ID
pl
.TP
.B Position
the 3 dimensional coordinates of the sphere center.
.TP
.B Orientation
a 3 dimensional vector : x,y,z. Each of these components must be in range [-1,1].
.TP
.B RGB1
an rgb format color : R,G,B. Each of these components should be a positive integer, and should not exceed 255.
.TP
.B RGB2
an rgb format color : R,G,B. Each of these components should be a positive integer, and should not exceed 255. This information is only given in the case of a chechered color. Otherwise, it is left empty.
.TP
.B Length
a positive real number that represents the length of the grid if a checkered color is used. When filled with 0, a
.B default
length will be chosen by the program. Like the 
.B RGB2 
field, the length is only given in the case of a checkered color. Otherwise, it is left empty.

.SH \tSQUARE
.TP
.B ID

.TP
.B Position
the 3 dimensional coordinates of the sphere center.
.TP
.B Orientation
a 3 dimensional vector : x,y,z. Each of these components must be in range [-1,1].
.TP
.B Side size
it should be a positive real number.
.TP
.B RGB1
an rgb format color : R,G,B. Each of these components should be a positive integer, and should not exceed 255.
.TP
.B RGB2
an rgb format color : R,G,B. Each of these components should be a positive integer, and should not exceed 255. This information is only given in the case of a chechered color. Otherwise, it is left empty.
.TP
.B Length
a positive real number that represents the length of the grid if a checkered color is used. When filled with 0, a
